# Responsive navigation

## User story

```
As a user,
I can see and interact with a responsive navigation menu
So I can browse the website easily on different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
```

## âœ… Acceptance criteria

- The navigation adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Ensure links in the navigation are functional
- Make sure the navigation is accessible (following [WCAGâ€™s AA compliance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)) using **a11y** (accessibility) best practices.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- The mobile dropdown menu has already been implemented to give you a head start.
- Use semantic HTML for better accessibility.
- Consider using CSS transitions or animations for a smooth open/close effect.
