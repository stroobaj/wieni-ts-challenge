# Server side fetch (Recipes page)

## User story

```
As a developer,  
I can fetch all the cocktails from the `/api/cocktails` endpoint and render them server-side in Card components,  
So the recipes page loads efficiently with pre-rendered data.
```

## âœ… Acceptance criteria

- The cocktail recipes are fetched from the /api/cocktails endpoint and rendered server-side.
